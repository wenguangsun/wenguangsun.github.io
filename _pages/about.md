I am Professor in the Department of Data Sciences and Operations ([the Statistics group](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/StatGroup/)) in the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California (USC). Before coming to USC, I was assistant professor in the department of Statistics at North Carolina State University (2008-2011). I completed my PhD in Biostatistics in 2008 at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Professor [T. Tony Cai](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~tcai/) from the Wharton School. I obtained my undergraduate degree (Mathematics and Statistics) in 2003 at Peking University, China. 

My research focuses on large-scale multiple testing, selective inference, empirical Bayes methods, transfer learning and statistical decision theory. This is my current [CV](https://wenguangsun.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
