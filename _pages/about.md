I am an Associate Professor of Statistics at the USC Marshall School of Business's Department of Data Sciences and Operations. I completed my PhD in 2008 at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Prof. T. Tony Cai. I obtained my undergraduate degree in 2008 at Peking University, China. 

My research focuses on Large-scale multiple testing, False discovery rate, Selective inference, Empirical Bayes and shrinkage estimation theory, and Statistical decision theory. 

I am also currently serving as the Associate Editor of the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B (2017-present) and as an Associate Editor of the Journal of Multivariate Analysis (2016-present). 

Currently, I am also the PhD program coordinator for the statistics group at USC Marshall. We welcome applications from highly qualified and motivated students.
