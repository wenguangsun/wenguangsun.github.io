I am Qiushi Chair Professor of Statistics and Director of the [Center for Data Science](http://cds.zju.edu.cn/en/) at Zhejiang University (ZJU, 2022-present). Before coming to ZJU, I was a faculty member in the Department of Data Sciences and Operations ([the Statistics group](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/StatGroup/)) in the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California (Professor 2021-2012, Associate Professor with tenure 2015-2021, Assistant Professor 2011-2015) in Los Angeles, California. Before going to USC, I was assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at the North Carolina State University (2008-2011), Raleigh, North Carolina. I was lucky to work under the supervision of Professor [T. Tony Cai](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~tcai/) from the Wharton School to complete my PhD (Biostatistics, 2003-2008) at the University of Pennsylvania. I obtained my BS degree (Probability and Statistics, 1999-2003) at Peking University, China.

My research interests include large-scale multiple testing, selective inference, empirical Bayes methods, conformal inference, fairness in machine learning, transfer learning and statistical decision theory.

You are welcome to visit our center at ZJU in Hangzhou, China. Hangzhou is a scenic and romantic city whose rich history and astounding beauty have been preserved for centuries. This historical and splendid city has been loved and praised in all ages (continuously for over a thousand years!) by famous [poets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Juyi), [writers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Shi) and [travelers](https://seetheworld.travelforkids.com/hangzhou-kinsai-marco-polos-favorite-city-in-china/).
