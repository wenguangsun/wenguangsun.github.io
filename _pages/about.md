I am a Professor in the Department of Data Sciences and Operations at the USC Marshall School of Business. I completed my PhD in 2008 at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Prof. T. Tony Cai. I obtained my undergraduate degree in 2008 at Peking University, China. 

My research focuses on large-scale multiple testing, selective inference, empirical Bayes methods and statistical decision theory. 

I am currently serving as the Associate Editor of Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B (2017-present).
